    <p id = "tribute-info">The largemouth bass is a popular freshwater gamefish. Their aggressive behavior provides excitement and competition for fishermen around the world. The largemouth diet consists of everything from baitfish to smaller mammals. Although preyed upon by a variety of other predators when young, the adult largemouth bass is generally regarded as an apex predator in its environment.</p>
